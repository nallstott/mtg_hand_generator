Welcome to the MTG hand generator! Right now, we’re just focusing on the main deck, without worrying about side boarding for ease of use.All you need is a csv file called deck.csv and the basic installation of python 3. Ignore the csv file titled "deck_writer.csv"The fields of your csv should be as follows:Card Name | how many of the card is in the deck(integer) | CMC | Card TypeBy default, a Boros burn deck is loaded in deck.csv as an example.The function returns the number of cards in your deck (with a preference for 60), your opening hand, and your next 3 draws.If you can think of any way to make this program better, feel free to let me know.When you’re ready, navigate to the folder in your directory this is all stored in, and execute the following command:python mtg_hand_generator.py
